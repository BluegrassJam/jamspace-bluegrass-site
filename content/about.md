# Our Mission

To be a great resource for lyrics and chords sheets for bluegrass musicians and provide information about jam sessions and festivals.


### A Little bit About Me 
I am a software developer in Knoxville, TN. I'm also a game/web developer with [Unibear Studio](http://unibearstudio.com/), and Bluegrass Chairman of the [Earl Park Fall Festival Foundation](https://www.earlparkfestival.org). My interests include: process and workflow optimization, automation, JAMstack technologies, software architecture, object oriented languages, game development. I also collect retro PC/console video games, dabble in gardening and woodworking. I have a passion for craft beer and bluegrass music. I play recreational ice hockey for fun.
