#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dm
Steel rails, chasing sunshine round the bend
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Winding through trees, like a ribbon in the wind
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dm
I don't mind, not knowing what lies down the track
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Cause I'm looking out ahead, to keep my mind from turning back

<br>

It's not the first time, I found myself alone at dawn

If I really had you once, then I'd have you, when I'm gone

Whistle blowing, blowing lonesome, in my mind

Calling me along, that never ending, metal line

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Sun is shinning, through the open box car door

Lying in, my mind, with the things I've known before

I've lost count of the hours, days, and times

Just the rhythm of the rails, keeps the motion in my mind

<br>

#### Chorus

#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
cause I'm looking out ahead To keep my mind from turning back
