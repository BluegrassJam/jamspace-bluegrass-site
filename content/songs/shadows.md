#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G                              
Let me reach out Love and touch you, let me hold you for awhile
#### Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am/G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D/F# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
I'd be known around the world, oh how I long to see you smile.
#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
There's a shadow on the moon, and the waters here below
#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
Do not shine the way they should, and I love ya just in case you didnt know.

<br>

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B/C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am/G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D/F#
**Let it go, let it happen like it happend once before**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em
**Its a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone,**
#### Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am/G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
**And if you do not believe me, come and gaze upon the shadow at your door.**

<br>

Won't you lie down by me baby, run your fingers through my hands

I'd be known around the town and still I do not understand

Is it me or is it you, or the shadow of a dream

Is it wrong to be in love, could it be the finest love I've ever seen

<br>

**Set it free, let it happen like it happened once before**

**Its a bitter wind, and it chills me to the bone**

**And if you do not believe me, come and gaze upon the shadow at your door.**

<br>


Please kiss me gently darlin, where the river runs away

from the mountains in the springtime, on a blue and windy day

Where there's beauty all around, as the shades of night grow deep

As the morning stars grow dim, they will find us in the shadows fast asleep.

<br> 

#### Chorus
