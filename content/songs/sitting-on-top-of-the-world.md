#### G
Twas in the spring, one sunny day
#### C			G
My good gal left me, Lord she went away

<br>

#### G		Em
**But now she's gone, and I don't worry**
#### G		D	G
**'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world**

<br>

She called me up, from El Paso

Sayin', come back Daddy, I need you so

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Don't like my peaches, don't shake my tree

Stay outta my orchard, let my peaches be

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Mississippi River, long, deep and wide

The woman I'm loving is on the other side

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Was in the summer, One early fall,

Just tryin' to find my Little Gal and all

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now don't come runnin' Holdin' up your hand.

Can get me a woman Quick as you can get a man.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Happen for days, Didn't know your name.

Oh, why should I worry Or crave you in vain?.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Went to the station, Down in the yard,

Gonna get me a freight train, Work's done got hard.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

The lonesome days, They have gone by,

Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.

<br>

#### Chorus
