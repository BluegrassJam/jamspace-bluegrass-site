#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
It's been ten long years since I left my home
#### D
In the hollow where I was born.
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise,
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
And a fox hunter blows his horn.

<br>

I fell in love with a girl from the town

I thought that she would be true.

I ran away to Charlottesville

and worked in a saw mill Crew.

<br>

#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**What have they done to the old home place,**
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**why did they tear it down?**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**And why did I leave the plow in the field,**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**and look for a job in the town.**

<br>

Well, the girl ran off with somebody else

the taverns took all my pay.

And here I stand where the old home stood

before they took it away.

<br>

Now the geese fly south and the cold wind moans

as I stand here and hang my head.

I've lost my love, I've lost my home

and now I wish that I was dead.

<br>

#### Chorus
