#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em
Can't you hear the whistle of my big spike hammer? Lord it's busting my side.
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
I've done all I can do to keep that woman, Still she's not satisfied.

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Hey, hey Della Mae. Why do you treat me this way?**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Hey, hey Della Mae. I'll get even some day**

<br>
I'm the best hammer swinger in this big section gang. Big Bill Johnson is my name.

This spike hammer that I swing for a dollar and a half a day. It's all for my Della Mae.

<br>
#### CHORUS
<br>
Well I've been lots of places, not much I ain't done. There's still a lot of things I'd like to see.

But this hammer that I swing or the woman that I love, Yeah one's gonna be the death of me. 

#### CHORUS

#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G 
Big spike hammer, big spike hammer.
