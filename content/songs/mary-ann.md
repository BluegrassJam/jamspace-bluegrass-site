#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Well there's a  girl ... on my  mind I can't get  over
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
That would break the heart of any man
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Without her things would fall to pieces
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Well I’m dreaming about my Mary Ann

<br>

#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**So I’ll just keep touching up my gray hair**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Live and hope some day she’ll understand**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Well it’s no matter if I live to be a hundred**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**There’ll always be a place in my heart for Mary Ann**

<br>

Well I  know she's out there somewhere in a  world that can't be  found

Just to think of  her still tears me  down 

And if teardrops were pennies, then I'd  be wealthy  man

From the tears that I've  cried for Mary Ann

<br>

#### Chorus
