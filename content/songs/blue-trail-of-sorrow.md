<pre class="nobackground">G     C         G               C         G</pre>
Blue trail of sorrow lies upon the ground,
<pre class="nobackground">D                                     G</pre>
And I get so lonely since you let me down,
<pre class="nobackground">                C      G                C           G</pre>
Well, I used to be so happy walking on these streets,
<pre class="nobackground">D                                     G</pre>
Now there's just sadness everywhere I meet,

<br>

<pre class="nobackground">C             G     C                D</pre>
**Start walkin baby, walk all over town,**
<pre class="nobackground">C               D                  G</pre>
**Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down,**
<pre class="nobackground">C             G    C                D</pre>
**Keep lookin' baby, I won't be around,**
<pre class="nobackground">C               D                 G</pre>
**Blue trail of sorrow on the ground,**

<br>

Now, when I had a dollar you'd stick right by me,

Now, I've got nothin but blues for company,

Well, I think I'll leave tomorrow, I'm tired of this town,

But, it won't be hard to find me if you look down on the ground,
