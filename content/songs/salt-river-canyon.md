She came down to the Salt River Canyon with a slow burning fire in her eyes

I was overcome by a yearning to hold her and tell her sweet lies

<br>

I heard tell of a prospector’s daughter who lived on the high timberline

Flames of passion have never burned hotter when the moment her sweet lips touched mine

<br>

**And our love filled the salt river canyon that night**

**Her golden hair shown in the silvery moon light**

**As we held each other the stars in the sky**

**Could not compare to the fire in her eyes**

**The fire in her eyes.**

<br>

Well she’s wild like the raging Salt River and in the morning she’ll be moving on 

And I know I can hold her forever If i could just hold back the dawn.

<br>
