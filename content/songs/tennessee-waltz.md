#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amaj7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F#m7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bm7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E7
When an old friend I happened to see
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amaj7
I introduced him to my loved one
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
And while they were dancin'
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

<br>

#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C#7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz 
#### F#m7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bm7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E7 
Now I know just how much I have lost
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amaj7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E7
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
