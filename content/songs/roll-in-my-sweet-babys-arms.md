#### A
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
#### E
Ain't gonna work on the farm
#### A
LayA round the shack 
#### D
Till the mail train comes back
#### E &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
And roll in my sweet baby's arms

<br>

**Roll in my sweet baby's arms** 

**Roll in my sweet baby's arms**      

**Lay round the shack**

**Till the mail train comes back**

**And  roll in my sweet baby's arms**

<br>

Now where were you last Friday night

While I was lyin' in jail

Walking the streets with another man

Wouldn't even go my bail

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I know your parents don't like me

They turn me away from your door

Had my life to live over

Wouldn't go there any more

<br>

#### Chorus
