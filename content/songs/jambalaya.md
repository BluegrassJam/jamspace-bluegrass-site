Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh

Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou

My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh

Son of a gun, we'll have good fun on the bayou

<br>

**Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a file gumbo**

**'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio**

**Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh**

**Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.**

<br>

Thibodeaux, Fontainbleau, the place is buzzin'

Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen

Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh my oh

Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a fillet gumbo

'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio

Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh

Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
