#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Eight weeks ago the night we parted
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
My blue skies now have turned to gray
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Alone I hang my head in sorrow
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
No other one could take your place

<br>

**you'll always be my blue eyed darling**

**I always love you as today**

**but when you left me for another**

**my broke my heart a million ways**

<br>

it makes no difference where you wander

it makes no difference where you stray

you'll always be my blue eyed darling

no other one could take your place

<br>

#### Chorus
