#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Two trees on the hillside of the mountain
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Always looking up towards the sky
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Reminds me of my papa and my momma
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Who lived there 80 years before they died

<br>

**Now the bright moon is shining in the valley**

**That old wagon leans against a stack of hay**

**Two graves on the hillside by a cabin**

**My mom and dad are resting there today**

<br>

The burning of the greenwood on the fireplace

The fallen snow around the red bud tree

The branches of the laurel by the creek bed

And the rippling waters of the gentle stream

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Papa used to talk about the young days

When he and momma first settled there

He spoke about the love of the mountains

That he and momma shared together there

<br>

#### Chorus
