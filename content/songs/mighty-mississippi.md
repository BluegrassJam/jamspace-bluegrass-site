And it's away, Dixie, steady as you go

On your way down to the Gulf of Mexico

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Oh! ol' man river keeps on callin' me
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
There ain't no place on earth I'd rather be
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
Well it's Greenville, Vicksburg and Natchez down the line
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G 
It's fare-thee-well ol' Memphis, Tennessee

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Mighty Mississippi, roll along**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**Lazy river, sing your song**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
**And it's away, Dixie, steady as you go**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**On your way down to the Gulf of Mexico**

<br>

Well, I used to ride aboard that River Queen

It was many a game of fortune I have seen

Oh, once I lost a million and I won it back again

On the way from Baton Rouge to New Orleans

<br>

#### Chorus
