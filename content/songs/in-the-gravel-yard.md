**In the gravel yard, with a number for my name**

**Making little rocks out of big rocks all day**

**Oh, the work is mighty hard in the gravel yard**

**I'll never be a free man, so they say**

<br>

Warden hear my plea, listen now to me

I killed a man that I caught with my wife

You'd probably done the same, so I am not to blame

Sentenced to the rest of my life

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

In the driven rain with a ball and chain

My hammer rings a low mournful sound

It sings a little song for the ones who done me wrong

Who lie beneath the cold, cold ground

<br>

#### Chorus
