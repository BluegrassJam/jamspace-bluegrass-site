#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Wish that I was on old Rocky Top down in the Tennessee hills
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top ain't no telephone bills

<br>

Once I had a man on Rocky Top half bear the other half cat

Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop I still dream about that

<br>

#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Good ole Rocky Top Rocky Top Tennessee Rocky Top Tennessee

<br>

Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top looking for a moonshine still

Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top I reckon they never will

<br>
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top the dirt's too rocky by far

That's why all the folks on Rocky Top get their corn from a jar

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I've had years of cramped up city life trapped like a duck in a pen

All I know is it's a pity life can't be simple again

<br>

#### Chorus
