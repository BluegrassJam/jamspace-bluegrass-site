#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
Some folks like the summertime When the they can walk about
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Strolling through the meadow green It's pleasant there, no doubt
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
But give me the wintertime When the snow is on the ground
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
I found her when the snow on the ground

<br>

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**I traced her little footprints in the snow**
#### C
**I found her little footprints in the snow**
#### F
**Bless that happy day when my darlinâ€™ lost her way**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**I found her when the snow was on the ground**

<br>

I went out to see her there was a big round moon.

Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon.

I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow

I found her when the snow was on the ground

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now she's up in heaven she's with the angel band.

I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land. 

Every time the snow falls it brings back memories.
 
I found her when the snow was on the ground

<br>

#### Chorus
