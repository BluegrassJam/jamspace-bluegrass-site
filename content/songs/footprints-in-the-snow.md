C								F
Some folks like the summertime When the they can walk about
G								C
Strolling through the meadow green It's pleasant there, no doubt
C							F
But give me the wintertime When the snow is on the ground
G					C
I found her when the snow on the ground

[Chorus]
C				G
I traced her little footprints in the snow
C
I found her little footprints in the snow
F
Bless that happy day when my darlinâ€™ lost her way
G					C
I found her when the snow was on the ground

I went out to see her
There was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out
But would be trturning soon
I found her little footprints and
I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
[Chorus]

Now she's up in heaven
She's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her
In that promised land
Everytime the snow falls
It brings back memories
I found her when the snow was on the ground
[Chorus]
