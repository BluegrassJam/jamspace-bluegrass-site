Oh, a long long time ago when I left my home to roam

Down in the hills of Tennessee

Was the sweetest little girl that was ever in this world

Down in the hills of Tennessee

<br>

**Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee**

**I know she's waiting there for me**

**Someday I'll settle down in that little country town**

**With that little girl of mine in Tennessee**

<br>

Oh, she begged me not to go “You'll be sorry dear I know”

For the way that you've been treating me

So I rambled all around but nothing could be found

To take the place of her in Tennessee

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Oh, someday I'll wander back to that little mountain shack

The little girl that's waiting there for me

I can see her smiling face waiting for me at the gate

The little girl of mine in Tennessee

<br>

#### Chorus
