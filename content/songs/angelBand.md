My latest sun is sinking fast. My race is nearly run.




G 		C	G
My strongest trials now are past.
D	 G
My triumph has begun.

D	G
Oh come angel band.Come and around me stand.
C 			G
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
D		G	
To my immortal home
C 			G
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
D		G
To my immortal home

Oh bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Who's blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory

{CHORUS] 
I know I'm near the holy ranks
Of friends and kindred dear
I brush the dew on Jordan's banks
The crossing must be near

[CHORUS] 
I've almost gained my heavenly home
My spirit loudly sings
The holy ones, behold they come
I hear the noise of wings

[CHORUS]
