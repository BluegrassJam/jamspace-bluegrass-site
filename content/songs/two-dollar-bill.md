Want to go home, boys, want to go home

Its dark and a raining and I want to go home

I'm on my long journey home

Homesick and lonesome and I'm feeling kind of blue

Homesick and lonesome and I'm feeling kind of blue

There's black smoke a rising and it surely is a train

Surely is a train boys, surely is a train

There's black smoke a rising and it surely is a train

I'm on my long journey home
