#### D
Early one day, the sun wouldn't shine.
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
I was walking down the street not feeling too fine.
#### D
I saw two old men with a bottle between 'em,
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
And this was the song that I heard them singing:

<br>

#### D
**"Lord, preserve us and protect us,**
#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
**We've been drinking whiskey 'fore breakfast."**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A

<br>

Well, I stopped by the steps where they was sitting

And I couldn't believe how drunk they were getting.

I said, "Old men, have you been drinking long?"

They said, "Just long enough to be singing this song."

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Well, they passed me the bottle and I took a little sip,

And it felt so good I just couldn't quit.

I drank some more and next thing I knew,

There were three of us sitting there singing this tune:

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

One by one, everybody in the town,

They heard our ruckus and they all came down.

And pretty soon all the streets were ringing

With the sound of the whole town laughing and singing:

<br>

#### Chorus
