#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
They say you're cold as ice I don't believe them
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7
Up goes my temperature when I'm next to you
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
They say you won't look twice I don't believe them
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
I think I feel something cooking baby how 'bout you

<br>

#### F
**Someday you'll see it's gonna be no one for you only me**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7
**Sometime sweet destiny will open up your heart**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
**And that's when I'm gonna be around just you wait and see**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**No more lonely you when you're loving only me**

<br>

Just give me your heart I'll never break it

I could never hurt someone as wonderful as you

I'm offering you my love you don't have to take it

But I wouldn't pass me by cause I know what's good for you

<br>

#### Chorus
