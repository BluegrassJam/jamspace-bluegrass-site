#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7
As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   A7
It's you that I am thinking of
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7
As I read the lines that to me were so dear
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
I remember our faded love

 
**I miss you, darling, more and more every day**
 
**As heaven would miss the stars above**
 
**With every heartbeat, I still think of you**
 
**And remember our faded love**

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>


As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had

As I watched the mating of the doves

It was in the springtime that you said goodbye

I remember our faded love

<br>

#### Chorus
