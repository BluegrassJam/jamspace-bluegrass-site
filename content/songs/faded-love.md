As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
     D        D             A7   A7
It's you that I am thinking of
     D        D7            G          G
As I read the lines that to me were so dear
   D          A7   D   -   G   D
I remember our faded love

 D            D        G                 G
I miss you, darling, more and more every day
 D               D         A7     A7
As heaven would miss the stars above
 D            D        G               G
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
     D          A7   D   -   G   D
And remember our faded love
D   A7   D - G   D
[instrumental]

As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watched the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling, more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
