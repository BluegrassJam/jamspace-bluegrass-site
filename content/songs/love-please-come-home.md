As you read this letter that write to you

Sweetheart, I hope you'll understand

That you're the only love I knew

Please forgive me if you can

<br>

**Sweetheart, I beg you to come home tonight**

**I'm so blue and alone**

**I promise that I'll treat you right**

**Love, oh love, oh please come home**

<br>

That old wind is cold and slowly creeping around

And the fire is burning low

The snow has covered up the ground

Your baby's hungry, sick and cold

<br>

#### Chorus
