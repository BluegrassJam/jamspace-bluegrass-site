#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
I will twine and will mingle my raven black hair
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
And the myrtle so green of an emerald hue
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
And the pale emanita and islip so blue

<br>

Oh he promised to love me, he promised to love

And cherish me always all others above

I woke from my dream and my idol was clay

My passion for loving had vanished away

<br>


Oh he taught me to love him, he called me his flower

A blossom to cheer him through life's weary hour

But now he has gone and left me alone

The wild flowers to weep and the wild birds to moan

<br>

I'll dance and I'll sing and my life will be gay

I'll banish this weeping, drive troubles away

I'll live yet to see him regret this dark hour

When he won and neglected this frail wildwood flower.
