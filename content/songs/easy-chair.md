#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G  
Clouds so swift rain won't lift. Gate won't close railings froze.
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Get your mind off wintertime you ain't going nowhere.

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Whoo-ee, ride me high. Tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Oh, Oh are we gonna fly down in the easy chair**

<br>

I don't care How many letters they send. Morning came and morning went.

Pack up your money. Pick up your tent. You ain't going nowhere.

<br> 

#### Chorus

<br>

Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots. Tailgates and substitutes.
          
Strap yourself To a tree with roots. You ain't going nowhere.

<br> 

#### Chorus

<br>

Now Genghis Kahn, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sheep.

We'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we get up to it.

<br> 

#### Chorus
