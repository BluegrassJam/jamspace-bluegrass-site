**It takes a worried man to sing a worried song,**

**It takes a worried man to sing a worried song,**

**It takes a worried man to sing a worried song,**

**I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long.**

<br>

Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg,

Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg,

Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg,

And on each link is initial of my name.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I asked the judge what might be my fine,

I asked the judge what might be my fine,

I asked the judge what might be my fine,

"Twenty-one years on the Rocky Mountain line."

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

The train arrived, sixteen coaches long,

The train arrived, sixteen coaches long,

The train arrived, sixteen coaches long,

The girl I love is on that train and gone.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

If any one asks you who composed this song,

If any one asks you who composed this song,

If any one asks you who composed this song,

Tell him it was I and I sing it all day long.

<br>

#### Chorus
