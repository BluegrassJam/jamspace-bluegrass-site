This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy

For my size, Buddy for my size

<br>

**Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow**

**How can I roll, when the wheels won't roll**

<br>

I'm going to the mountain, just to see my baby

And I ain't coming back, no I ain't coming back

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

There ain't one hammer, down in this tunnel

That can ring like mine, that can ring like mine

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Rings like silver, shines like gold

Rings like silver, shines like gold

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

This old hammer, it killed John Henry

Ain't gonna kill me, ain't gonna kill me

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

It's a long way to Harlan, and a long way to Hazard

Just to get a little booze, just to get a little booze

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Buddy when I'm long gone, won't you make my tombstone

Out of number nine coal, out of number nine coal

<br>

#### Chorus
