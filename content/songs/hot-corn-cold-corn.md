I met an old cook just a reelin' and a pitchin' Yes sir

<br>

**Hot Corn, cold corn, bring along the demijohn** (x3)

**Fair thee well, uncle Bill, see you in the morning Yes sir**

Old aunt Peggy, won't you fill'em up again

Old aunt Peggy, won't you fill'em up again

Old aunt Peggy, won't you fill'em up again

I ain't had a drink since the lord knows when Yes sir

<br>

All I need to keep me happy

Is two little boys to call me Pappy

One named Paul and one named Davy

One likes ham and the other loves gravy Yes sir

<br>

Preacher's in the pulpit takin' in the money

Children in the bee hive takin' in the honey

Old aunt Sally just a jumpin' for joy

Happiest lot of people that ever I saw Yes sir

<br>

Preacher's all a comin' and the children are a cryin'

Preacher's all a comin' and the children are a cryin'

Preacher's all a comin' and the children are a cryin'

Chicken heads a-wringin' and a toenails flyin'Yes sir
