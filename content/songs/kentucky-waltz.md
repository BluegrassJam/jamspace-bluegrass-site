#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky Beneath the beautiful harvest moon
#### C
And I was the boy that was lucky But it all ended too soon
#### C7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
As I sit here alone in the moonlight I see your smiling face
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7
And I long once more for your embrace 
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
and the beautiful Kentucky waltz.
