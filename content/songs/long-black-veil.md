#### C
Ten years ago on a cold dark night
#### G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Someone was killed beneath the town hall light
#### C
There were few at the scene but they all agreed
#### G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
 
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**She walks these hills**
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**In a long black veil**
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**She visits my grave**
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**When the night winds wail**
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**Nobody knows nobody sees**
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C 
**Nobody knows but me**  
 
<br>
 
The judge said son what is your alibi
       
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die
 
I spoke not a word though it meant my life
       
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
 
 <br>
 
 #### Chorus
 
 <br>
                                       
The scaffold's high and eternity near
    
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
                                                 
But sometimes at night when the cold wind blows
    
In a long black veil she cries over my bones

<br>

#### Chorus
