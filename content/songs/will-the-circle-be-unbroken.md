#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was standing by my window
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
On a cold and cloudy day
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I saw that hearse come rolling
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
For to carry my mother away

<br>

**Will the circle be unbroken**

**By and by, Lord, by and by**

**There's a better home awaiting**

**In the sky, Lord, in the sky**

<br>

Well I told the undertaker

Undertaker please drive slow

For the body that you are hauling

Lord, I hate to see her go

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Well I followed close behind her

Tried to hold up and be brave

But I could not hide my sorrow

When they laid her in her grave

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Went back home, Lord, oh so lonesome

Since my mother she was gone

All my brothers, sisters crying

What a home so sad and 'lone

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>
