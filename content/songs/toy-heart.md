**Darling you toyed with a toy heart**

<br>

You played with my poor heart like a toy

This toy broke and then we had to part

It never can be mended I hope this romance's ended

Darling you toyed with a toy heart

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now darling you know you've done me wrong

Your love for me has passed and gone

I'll find somebody new I hope that they'll be true

Darling you toyed with a toy heart

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now darling my time will come some day

Time alone will heal my broken heart

The clouds will roll away the sun will shine someday

Darling you toyed with a toy heart

<br>

#### Chorus
