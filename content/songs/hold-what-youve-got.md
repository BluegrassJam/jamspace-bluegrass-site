**I've been thinking about you, and I'm on my way.**

**Don't sell the house, don't wreck the car**
#### C
**Stay there honey right where you are**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**If you hold what you got, I'm coming home to stay.**

<br>

Well, in my mind, I can see that’s a mighty good sign that  I need you

so that’s why, I can't wait to get back home.

So squeeze yourself real good and tight, and I'll be home before daylight

If you hold what you got, I'm a coming home to stay.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>
Well when I get back, honey I ain't leaving I been too lonely, little to much grieving

when I get back, honey this time I'm gonna stay.

Well we won't fuss and we won't fight and this time things is going to be alright

if you hold what you got, I'm a coming home to stay.

<br>

#### Chorus
