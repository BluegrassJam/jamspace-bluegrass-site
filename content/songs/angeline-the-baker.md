Angeline the baker, lives on the village green.
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
The way I always loved her, beats all you’ve ever seen.
 
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**Angeline the baker, Angeline I know.**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G 
**Should have married Angeline, twenty years ago.**

Angeline the baker, age of 43.

Fed her sugar candy, but she still won't marry me.
  
#### CHORUS

Her father was a baker, his name was Uncle Sam.

I never can forget her, no matter where I am.

#### CHORUS

She said couldn’t do hard work, because she is not stout.

Baked the biscuits every day and poured the coffee out.

#### CHORUS

I bought Angeline a brand new dress, neither black nor brown.

It was the color of a stormy skies, before the rain came down.

#### CHORUS

Sixteen horses in my team, the leader he was blind.

I dreamed that I was dying, I saw my Angeline.
