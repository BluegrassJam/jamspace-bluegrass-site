#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E 
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

<br>

#### A
**Up on Cripple Creek she sends me**
#### D
**If I spring a leak she mends me**
#### E
**I don't have to speak, she defends me**
#### F#m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one**

<br>

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go

She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show

The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one

When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough we had won

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half

And she tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh

Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure do like to see

That's how that little sweet thing of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>


Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box

She said, "I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk"

Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet

And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can t be beat 

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold

And this living off the road is getting pretty old

So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in

But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted 

To go and see my Bessie again.

<br>

#### Chorus
