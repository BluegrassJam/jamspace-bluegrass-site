#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Somewhere in my thoughts there lives a lady
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
She's walking back and forth across my mind
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Blocking out each chance of me forgetting
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	G
Assuring me she'll be there for some time

<br>

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Her golden hair is tied around my memory**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D						
**The pain she left with me is here to stay**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**I'm doing all I can to go on living**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**And yet I die a little more each day**

<br>

Now that I'm alone with just my memory

I've had some time for counting my mistakes

And loving her stands out from all the others

But that was one I couldn't help but make

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Funny how some thoughts can be so painful

And how refuse to go away

I'm doing all I can to go on living

And still I die a little more each day

<br>

#### Chorus
