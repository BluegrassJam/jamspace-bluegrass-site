### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cadd2/B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Hey momma here's a letter from
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dm
your son
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Well I think my city days are done ma
#### Bb &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
and it ain't bee three weeks since I came

<br>

Hey momma I do remember 

what you said

Say your prayers, before you go to bed son

And remember city women ain't the same

<br>


#### Bb &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
**I'm like a John Deere tractor in a half acre field.** 
#### A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**Trying to plow a furrow where the soil is made of steel.**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**Oh I wish I was home ma, where the bluegrass is growing**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
**and the sweet country girls don't complain**

<br>

Momma so much perfume I thought

I'd drown

and the Lord didn't seem to be nowhere around.

Hey I fell like a flower from the vine.

<br>

Ah she was pretty lord know

I thought that she would bring me joy

She laughed, she called, me country boy ma

and after she had been so kind.

<br>

#### Chorus
