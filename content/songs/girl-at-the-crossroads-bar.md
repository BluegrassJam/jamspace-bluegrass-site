(D) I walked out tonight for a ramble round. I didn't mean to stay, just to view the (A) town. When I (G) saw her smilin' from a (D) far. As she walked (G) into that (A) crossroads (D) bar.
(D) Well I walked inside and sat me down. Ordered sweet red wine and I drank it (A) down. She (G) came and set beside me (D) there with a dark brown (G) eyes and the (A) red, red (D) hair.
(D) I told her that I love her true. Anything you want I'll surely (A) do. Said a (G) man like you don't get too (D) far. With a girl like (G) me at the (A) crossroads (D) bar.
(D) I like smokey lights and a lonesome song. And I won't do right if I can do you (A) wrong. You (G) want the moon to burn behind the darkest (D) star. And you won't find (G) love (A) at the crossroads (D) bar.
And you won't find (G) love (A) at the crossroads (D) bar.
