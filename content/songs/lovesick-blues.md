#### D
**I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lawd**
#### A7
**Since my baby said goodbye**
#### A7
**And I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo**
#### D
**All I do is sit and sigh-igh, oh, Lawd**
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7
**That last long day she said goodbye**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B7
**Well Lawd I thought I would cry**
#### E7
**She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'**
#### A7
**Lawd, I love to hear her when she calls me**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7
**Sweet dad-ad-ad-dy, such a beautiful dream**
#### A7
**I hate to think it all o-o-ver**
#### F#
**I've lost my heart it seems**
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7
**I've grown so used to you somehow**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B7
**Well, I'm nobody's sugar-daddy now**
#### E7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7
**And I'm lo-on-lonesome**
#### D
**I got the Lovesick Blu-ues.**

#### F# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bm
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
#### F# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bm
That's what's the matter with me
#### F# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bm
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
#### E7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7
But she don't care about me
#### A7
Lawd, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied
#### D7
But she just wouldn't stay
#### E7
So now that she is lea-eav-in'
#### A7
This is all I can say.

<br>
