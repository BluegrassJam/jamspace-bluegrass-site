#### Chorus

<br>

We always wear a great big smile,

we never do look sour.

Travel all over the country,

playing music by the hour .

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Oh, walk and talk suzy,

Walk and talk suzy.

Walk and talk suzy,

Walk and talk suzy.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Little bee sucks the blossom,

Big bee gets the honey,

Dark man picks the cotton,

White man gets the money.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I went to the Railroad,

Laid my head down on the track.

I thought about that girl of mine

And I gradually eased it back.

<br>
