#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7
**Get down boys, go back home back to the girl you love**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Treat her right never wrong How mountain girls can love.**

#### G				
Iâ€™m Ridin' the night in the high cold wind
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
on the trail of the old lonesome pine
#### G				
Thinkin' of you,baby, feelin' so blue 
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Wonderin' why I left you behind.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Remember the night we strolled down the lane

Our hearts were gay and happy then

You whispered to me as I held you close

We hoped the night would never end.

<br>

#### Chorus
