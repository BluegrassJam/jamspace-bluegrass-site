Over yonder stands little Maggie
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
With a dram glass in her hand
#### F
She's drinking away her troubles
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
She's courting another man

<br>

Last time I saw little Maggie

She was setting on the banks of the sea

With a forty-four around her

And a banjo on her knee

<br>

Pretty flowers were made for blooming

Pretty stars were made to shine

Pretty women were made for loving

Little Maggie was made for mine

<br>

Lay down your last gold dollar

Lay down your gold watch and chain

Little Maggie's gonna dance for daddy

Listen to this old banjo ring

<br>

Go away go away Little Maggie

Go and do the best you can

I'll get me another woman

You can get you another man
