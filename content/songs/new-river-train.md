Darling you can't love one

Darling you can't love one

You can't love one and have any fun

Oh darling you can't love one

<br>

Darling you can't love two

Darling you can't love two

You can't love two and your little heart be true

Oh darling you can't love two

<br>

Darling you can't love three

Darling you can't love three

You can't love three and still love me

Oh darling you can't love three

<br>

Darling you can't love four

Darling you can't love four

You can't love four and love me anymore

Oh darling you can't love four
