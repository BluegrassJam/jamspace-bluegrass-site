#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Darling, I have come to tell you though it almost breaks my heart,
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G 
That before the morning, darling we'll be many miles apart.

<br>

**Don't this road look rough and rocky? Don't that sea look wide and deep?**

**Don't my baby look the sweetest when she's in my arms asleep?**

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Don't you hear the nightbirds calling far across the deep blue sea?

While of others you are thinking won't you sometimes thinking of me?

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

One more kiss before I leave you. One more kiss before we part.

You have caused me lots of trouble. Darling, you have broke my heart.

<br>

#### Chorus
