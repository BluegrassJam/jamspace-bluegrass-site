<pre class="nobackground">C               	F</pre>
My heart is sad and I’m lonely
<pre class="nobackground">C              	G7</pre>
For the only one I love
<pre class="nobackground">C          	F</pre>
When will I see her oh no never
<pre class="nobackground">C   	G7         	C</pre>
Till we meet in heaven above

<pre class="nobackground">         	F</pre>
So bury me beneath the willow
<pre class="nobackground">C                    	G7</pre>
Under the weeping willow tree
<pre class="nobackground">C               	F</pre>
So she will know where I am sleeping
<pre class="nobackground">C  	G7               	C</pre>
And perhaps she’ll weep for me


She told me that she dearly loved me

How could I believe it untrue

Until the angels softly whispered

She will prove untrue to you

<br>
#### Chorus

Tomorrow was our wedding day

Oh God oh God where can he be

She’s out a-courting with another

And no longer cares for me

<br>
#### Chorus
