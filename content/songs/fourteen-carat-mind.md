#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
I still recall the morning that I met you
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Standing out in front of Wilson's five and dime
#### Bm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Staring through the window at the jewelry
#### E &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7
Hungry for the things you couldn't buy
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Just like a fool I thought that I could please you
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
I saw you had an eye for things that shine
#### D
I paid seven saw mill dollars for a bracelet
#### A7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

#### Bm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7
**With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine**
#### Bm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Every thing except my soul has been surrendered**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7
**Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.**

<br>

The cabin that I built in West Virginia

Was not enough to keep you satisfied

'Cause a man that's got a saw mill occupation

Can't afford to feed a rich girls' appetite

I wonder if you're still with Willie Jackson

Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive

Ol' Willie he gave up his wife and children

Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

<br>

#### Chorus
