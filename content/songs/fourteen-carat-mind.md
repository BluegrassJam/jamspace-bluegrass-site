[D] I still recall the [A7] morning that I [D] met you
Standing [G] out in front of Wilson's five and [D] dime
Staring through the [Bm] window at the [G] jewelry
[E] Hungry for the things you couldn't [A7] buy
Just [D] like a fool I [A7] thought that I could [D] please you
I saw you had an eye for [D7] things that [G] shine
I paid seven saw mill dollars for a [D] bracelet
Just to satisfy your [A7] fourteen carat [D] mind.

CHORUS
[Bm] Layin' by these railroad tracks in [G] Denver
With a [D] hurtin' head and a half a pint of [A7] wine
Every-[Bm] thing except my soul has been sur-[G] rendered
Just to [D] satisfy your [A7] fourteen carat [D] mind.

The cabin that I built in West Virginia
Was not enough to keep you satisfied
'Cause a man that's got a saw mill occupation
Can't afford to feed a rich girls' appetite
I wonder if you're still with Willie Jackson
Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive
Ol' Willie he gave up his wife and children
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

CHORUS
