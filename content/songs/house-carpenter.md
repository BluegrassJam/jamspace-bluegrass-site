"And it's all for the love of thee." 

<br>

Come in, come in, my own true love,

And have a seat by me.

It's been three-fourths of a long, long year,

Since together, we have been.

<br>

"I can't come in and I can't sit down,

"For I've only a moment's time.

"They say you're married to a house carpenter,

"And your heart will never be mine.

<br>

"I could have married a King's daughter, fair,

"And she would have married me,

"But I have forsaken her crowns of gold,

"And it's all for the love of thee."

<br>

"Now you forsake your house carpenter,

"And go along with me.

"I'll take you where the grass grows green.

"On the banks of the deep blue sea."

<br>

Then she picked up a darlin' little babe,

And kisses, she gave it three.

Saying "Stay right here, my dalrin' little baby,

"And keep your pappa company."

<br>

They had not been on the ship two weeks,

I'm sure it was not three,

Till his true love began to weep and to mourn,

And she wept most bitterly.

<br>

Sayin': "Are you weepin' for my silver and my gold."

Sayin': "Are you weepin' for my store?

"Or are you weepin' for your house carpenter,

"Whose face you'll never see no more?"

<br>

"A curse, a curse to the sailor," she cried."A curse, a curse," she swore.

"You robbed me of my darlin' little babe,"That I shall never see no more."

They had not been on the ship three weeks,I'm sure it was not four,

When there came a leak in the bottom of the ship,And sank them for to rise no more.
