#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em
I awoke in a daze, to the heat of the morning
#### Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
The letter you wrote, still lay by my bed
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em
I felt in my heart, that dagger of sorrow
#### Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
How I wanted to die, from words that I read

<br>

#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Last night I heard, a lonesome dove crying**
#### Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am/G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F
**Where will I go, oh what will I do**
#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	C
**I’m left here alone, in the heat of the morning**
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Forsaken by love, unwanted by you**

<br>

All of my dreams, have been so deceitful

Sweet songs of the night, are now bitter and cruel

The morning sunlight, is just a reminder

That I’m starting another day without you

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I’m left here alone, in the heat of the morning

Forsaken by love, unwanted by you
