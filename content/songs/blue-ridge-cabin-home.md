#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C 
There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G 
Where I wandered when I was a lad
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C 
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
In those Blue Ridge hills far away

<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C 
**Oh I love those hills of old Virginia**
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**From those Blue Ridge hills I did roam**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C 
**When I die won't you bury me on the mountain**
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G  
**Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain home**

<br>

 
Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack

In those Blue Ridge hills far away
 
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest

They are sleeping in peace together there

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I return to that old cabin home with the sigh

I've been longing for days gone by

When I die won't you bury me on that old mountain side

Make my resting place upon the hills so high

#### Chours
