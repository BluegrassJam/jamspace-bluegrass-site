<pre class="nobackground">G                  C</pre>
There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
<pre class="nobackground">D7                  G</pre>
Where I wandered when I was a lad
<pre class="nobackground">G                  C</pre>
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
<pre class="nobackground">D7                  G</pre>
In those Blue Ridge hills far away

<br>

<pre class="nobackground">G                  C</pre>
**Oh I love those hills of old Virginia**
<pre class="nobackground">D7                  G</pre>
**From those Blue Ridge hills I did roam**
<pre class="nobackground">G                  C</pre>
**When I die won't you bury me on the mountain**
<pre class="nobackground">D7                  G</pre>  
**Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain home**

<br>

<pre class="nobackground">G                  C</pre>
Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
<pre class="nobackground">D7                  G</pre>
In those Blue Ridge hills far away
<pre class="nobackground">G                  C</pre>
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
<pre class="nobackground">D7                  G</pre>
They are sleeping in peace together there

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>
<pre class="nobackground">G                  C</pre>
I return to that old cabin home with the sigh
<pre class="nobackground">D7                  G</pre>
I've been longing for days gone by
<pre class="nobackground">G                  C</pre>
When I die won't you bury me on that old mountain side
<pre class="nobackground">D7                  G</pre>
Make my resting place upon the hills so high

#### Chours
