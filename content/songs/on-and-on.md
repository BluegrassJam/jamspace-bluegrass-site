#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C			
Traveling down this long lonesome highway
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
I'm so lonesome I could cry
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
With memories of how we once loved each other
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
And now you are saying good-bye

<br>

**On and on I'll follow my darling**

**And I wonder where she can be**

**On and on I'll follow my darling**

**I wonder if she ever thinks of me**

<br>

I've cried I've cried for you little darling

It breaks my heart to hear you name

My friends they all so loved you my darling

And they think that I'm to blame

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I had to follow you little darling

I can't sleep when the sun goes down

Cause by your side is my destination

The road is clear and there's where I'm bound

<br>

#### Chorus
