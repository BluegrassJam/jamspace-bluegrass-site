I asked my love to take a walk, Just to walk a little ways.

An' as we walked, then we would talk all about our wedding day.

#### CHORUS
**Darlin', say that you'll be mine. In our home we'll happy be down beside where the waters flow on the banks of the Ohio.**

I took her by her lilly white hand and dragged her down that bank of sand.
There I threw her in to drown. I watched her as she floated down.

#### CHORUS

I took her by her pretty white hand.I led her down the banks of sand.
I plunged her in where she would drown and watched her as she floated down.

#### CHORUS

I was walking home between twelve and one,thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done.
I'd killed the girl I love, you see, because she would not marry me.

#### CHORUS

The very next day, at half past four, the sheriff walked right to my door.
He says, "Young man, don't try to run. You'll must pay for this awful crime you've done.
