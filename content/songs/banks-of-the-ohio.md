I asked my love to take a walk, Just a little way's with me.

<pre class="nobackground">C             G		         D	               G</pre>
An' as we walked, then we would talk all about our wedding day.



#### CHORUS
**Darlin', say that you'll be mine. In our home we'll happy be down beside where the waters flow on the banks of the Ohio.**

I held a knife against her breast as into my arms she pressed.
She said Willie, don't you murder me I'm unprepared for eternity.

#### CHORUS

I took her by her pretty white hand.I led her down the banks of sand.
I plunged her in where she would drown and watched her as she floated down.

#### CHORUS

Returning home between twelve and one,thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done.
I'd killed the girl I love, you see, because she would not marry me.

#### CHORUS

The very next day, at half past four, the sheriff walked right to my door.
He says, "Young man, don't try to run. You'll must pay for this awful crime you've done.
