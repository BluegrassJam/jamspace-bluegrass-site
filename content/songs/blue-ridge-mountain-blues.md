When I was young and in my prime I left my home in Caroline.
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Now all I do is sit and pine for all those folks I left behind.

I've got the Blue Ridge Mountain Blues and I stand right here to say.

My grip is packed to travel, and I'm scratching gravel to that Blue Ridge far away.

<br>
I'm gonna stay right by my Pa. I'm gonna do right by my Ma.

I'll hang around the cabin door.No work, nor worry any more.

<br>

I've got the Blue Ridge Mountain Blues, Gonna see my old dog Tray.

Gonna hunt the 'possum, where the corn-tops blossom on the Blue Ridge far away.   

<br>

I see a window with a light I see two heads of snowy white

It seems I hear them both recite "Where is my wandering boy tonight?"

<br>

I've got the Blue Ridge Mountain Blues and I stand right here to say

Every day I'm counting, until I climb that mountain on the Blue Ridge far away.
