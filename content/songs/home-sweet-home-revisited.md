#### D
The old home town is sure in trouble
#### G
It looks like it must have doubled in sin and size
#### D
Since I've been gone

The papers are all full of killing
#### G
Two million people willing to die
#### D
For something they've never known
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
The city streets of drunks and junk and stone
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
A heaven made of hell, they call their home

<br>
Chorus
<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Now it's gone like the life of a child
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
When it turns its back on your mind
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Tomorrow has no home sweet home
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
Look what they've done to   mine,
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
it just faded into time

<br>

Grandfather's watch he gave me, is just another memory

That I've kept the way it always was

And ever since he died it just won't run

I always knew I was his favorite one

<br>

And that old house we used to live in, the roof is fallin' in

Like every other one along the block

It took twenty years to pay and ten to rot

That's says it's all just better off forgot
