#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B7
Sitting in the morning sun
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
I'll be sitting when the evening comes
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B7
Watching the ships roll in
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
And then I watch them roll away again, yeah

<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E
**I'm sitting on the dock of the bay**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E
**Watching the tide roll away**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
**Ooo, I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E
**Wasting time**

<br>
 
I left my home in Georgia

Headed for the 'Frisco Bay

'Cause I've had nothing to live for

And look like nothin's gonna come my way

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Looks like, nothing's gonna change
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Everything still remains the same
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

<br>

Sitting here resting my bones

And this loneliness won't leave me alone

It's two thousand miles I roamed

Just to make this dock my home

<br>

#### Chorus
