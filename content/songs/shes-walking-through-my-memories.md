Somewhere in my thoughts there lives a lady

She's walking back and forth across my mind

Blocking out each chance of me forgetting

Assuring me she'll be there for some time

<br>

**Her golden hair is tied around my memory**

**The pain she left with me is here to stay**

**I'm doing all I can to go on living**

**And yet I die a little more each day**

<br>

Now that I'm alone with just my memory

I've had some time for counting my mistakes

And loving her stands out from all the others

But that was one I couldn't help but make

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Funny how some thoughts can be so painful

And how refuse to go away

I'm doing all I can to go on living

And still I die a little more each day

<br>

#### Chorus
