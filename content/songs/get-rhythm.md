G
Hey get rhythm when you get the blues
        C                       G
Hey get rhythm when you get the blues
Yes a jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind
    C           D7          G
Get rhythm when you get the blues
 
G
Little shoeshine boy never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bending low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
 

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Hey get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime just a nickel a shoe
Does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues
 
Well I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be a-working that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a popping and he said again
 
Chorus
