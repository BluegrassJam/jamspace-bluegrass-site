**Hey get rhythm when you get the blues**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Hey get rhythm when you get the blues**
**Yes a jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine**
**It'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Get rhythm when you get the blues**
 

Little shoeshine boy never gets low down

But he's got the dirtiest job in town

Bending low at the peoples' feet

On the windy corner of the dirty street

Well I asked him while he shined my shoes

How'd he keep from getting the blues

He grinned as he raised his little head

Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
 
<br>

#### Chorus

<br>
 
Well I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy

And I thought I was gonna jump for joy

Slapped on the shoe polish left and right

He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight

He stopped once to wipe the sweat away

I said you're a mighty little boy to be a-working that way

He said I like it with a big wide grin

Kept on a popping and he said again
 
<br>

#### Chorus
