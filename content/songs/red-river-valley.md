#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
From this valley they say you are leaving
#### D7
We shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
For you take with you all of the sunshine
#### D7	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
That has brighten our pathway a while

<br>

**Come and sit by my side if you love me**

**Do not hasten to bid me adieu**

**Just remember the Red River Valley**

**And the cowboy that loved you so true**

<br>

For a long time my darling I've waited

For the sweet words you never would say

Now at last all my fond hopes have vanished

For they say that you're going away

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Do you think of the valley you're leaving

O how lonely and how dreary it will be

And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking

And the pain you are causing to me

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

They will bury me where you have wandered

Near the hills where the daffodils grow

When you're gone from the Red River Valley

For I can't live without you I know

<br>

#### Chorus
