(D) I was born in East Virginia. North (G) Carolina I did go (D). There I (G) met a fair young (D) maiden whose (A) name I did not (D) know.
(D) Well her hair was dark in color and her (G) cheeks were rosy red (D). On her (G) breast she wore white (D) lilies where I (A) longed to lay my head (D).
(D) In my heart, you are my darling. At my (G) door, you're welcome in (D). At my (G) gate, I'll always (D) meet you for you're the (A) girl, I tried to win (D).
(D) I don't want your greenback dollar I don't (G) want your watch and chain (D). All I (G) want is your heart (D) darling say that you'll (A) be mine again (D).
(D) I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the (G) sun don't ever shine (D). Than for (G) you to love (D) another I would (A) surely loose my mind (D).
(D) I'll go back to East Virginia 'cause North (G) Carolina ain't my home (D). I'll go (G) back to East (D) Virginia leave North (A) Carolina all alone (D).
(D) Well when I'm dead and in my coffin with my (G) feet turned toward the sun (D). Come and (G) sit beside me (D) darling come and (A) think on what you done (D).
(D) I was born in East Virginia North (G) Carolina I did go (D). There I (G) courted a fair young (D) maiden whose (A) name I did not (D) know.
