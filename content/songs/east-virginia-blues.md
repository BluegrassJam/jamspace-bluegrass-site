I was born in east Virginia 

North Carolina I did roam 

There I met a fair pretty maiden 

Her name and age, I do not know

<br>

Her hair, it was of a bright some color 

And her lips of a ruby red 

On her breast she wore white lilies 

There I longed to lay my head

<br>

Well, in my heart you are my darling 

And at my door, you're welcome in 

At my gate, I'll meet you my darling 

If your love I could only win

<br>

I'd rather be in some dark holler 

Where the sun refused to shine 

Then to see you another man's darling 

And to know that you'll never be mine

<br>

Well, in the night I'm dreaming about you 

In the day, I find no rest 

Just the thought of you my darling 

Sends aching pains all through my breast

<br>

Well, when I'm dead and in my coffin 

With my feet turned toward the sun 

Come and sit beside me darling 

Come and think on the way you done
