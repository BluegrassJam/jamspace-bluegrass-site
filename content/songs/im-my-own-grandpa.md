#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**I'm my own grandpa**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
**I'm my own grandpa**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**It sounds funny I know, but it really is so**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**Oh, I'm my own grandpa.**

#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
Now many, many years ago when I was twenty-three
#### D
I was married to a widder who was pretty as can be
#### G
This widder had a grown up daughter who had hair of red
#### E &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
My father fell in love with her and soon they two were wed.

<br>

This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life

My daughter was my mother for she was my father's wife

To complicate the matter even though it brought me joy

I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.

<br>

My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad

And so became my uncle though it made me very sad

For if he was my uncle then that also made him brother

Of the widder's grown up daughter who of course was my step-mother.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>


Father's wife then had a son who kept him on the run

And he became my grandchild for he was my daughter's son

My wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue

Because although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now if my wife is my grandmother, then I'm her grandchild

And every time I think of it, it nearly drives me wild

For now I have become the strangest case you ever saw

As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpa.

<br>

#### Chorus
