#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Now come and listen to my story
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7
A story that I know is true
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
About a rose that blooms in Georgia
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
With a hair of gold and a heart so true

<br>

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Way down in the Blue Ridge Mountains**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7
**Way down where the tall pines grow**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**Lives my sweetheart of the mountains**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**She's my little Georgia rose**

<br>


Her mother left her with another

A care free life she had planned

The baby now is a lady

The one her mother could not stand

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

We'd often sing those songs together

I watch her do her little part

She'd smile at me when I would tell her

That she was my own sweetheart

<br>

#### Chorus
