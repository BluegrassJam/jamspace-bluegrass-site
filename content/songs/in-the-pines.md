#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines**
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**And we shiver when the cold winds blow**

<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
The longest train I ever saw
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Went down that Georgia line
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
The engine passed at six o' clock
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
And the cab passed by at nine

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Little girl, little girl, what have I done

That makes you treat me so

You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn

You caused me to leave my home

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I asked my captain for the time of day

He said he threw his watch away

A long steel rail and a short cross tie

I'm on my way back home

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I wish to the Lord I'd never been born, 

Or died when I was young

I never would have kissed your sweet, sweet lips

Or heard you rattling tongue

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Tell me where did you get them pretty little shoes

And the dress you wear so fine

I got my shoes from a railroad man

Got my dress from a driver in the mine
