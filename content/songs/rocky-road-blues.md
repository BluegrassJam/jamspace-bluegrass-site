<br>

Hey I've got those blues I'm wearing out the soles of my shoes

Yes I've got those blues I'm wearing out the soles of my shoes

My gal went way and left me she left me with the doggone blues

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

You'll never miss your water until the well runs dry

You'll never miss your water until the well runs dry

You'll never miss your woman until she says goodbye

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Ah and I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home

Yeah I wish to the Lord you'd bring my woman back home

I'm not so lonesome I just don't want to be alone

<br>

#### Chorus
