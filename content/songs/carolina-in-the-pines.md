G				Am
She came to me, said she knew me 
	C			G
Said she'd known me a long time 
	Am			Bm	
And she spoke of being in love
C			G 
With every mountain she had climbed 
	G			Am
And she talked of trails she'd walked up 
	C		G
Far above the timberline 
		Am		Bm
From that night on I knew I'd write songs 
	C	D	G	Am	 C	G
With Carolina in the pines 

There's a new moon on the fourteenth 
First Quarter the 21st 
And the full moon in the last week 
Brwaaaings a fullness to this earth 
There's no guesswork in the clockwork 

On the worlds part or mine 
There are nights I only feel right 
With Carolina in the pines 

When the frost shows on the windows 
And the wood stove smokes and glows 
As the fire grows we can warm our souls 
Watching rainbows in the cove 
And well talk of trails weve walked up 
Far above the timberline 
There are nights I only feel right 
With Carolina in the pines
