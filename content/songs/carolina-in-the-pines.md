She came to me, said she knew me. Said she'd known me a long time. 
#### Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G 	
And she spoke of being in love, with every mountain she had climbed. 
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
And she talked of trails she'd walked up far above the timberline. 
#### Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bm
From that night on, I knew I'd write songs

with Carolina in the pines. 

<br>

There's a new moon on the fourteenth First Quarter the 21st.

And the full moon in the last week brings a fullness to this earth. 

There's no guesswork in the clockwork on the worlds part or mine. 

There are nights I only feel right With Carolina in the pines 

<br>

When the frost shows on the windows and the wood stove smokes and glows. 

As the fire grows we can warm our souls watching rainbows in the cove. 

And well talk of trails we've walked up far above the timberline. 

There are nights I only feel right with Carolina in the pines.
