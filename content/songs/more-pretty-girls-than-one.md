#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C7
**There's more pretty girls than one**
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C7
**More pretty girls than one**
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**Any old town that I ramble all around in**
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**There's more pretty girls than one**

<br>

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C7
Mama talked to me last night

#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C7
She gave to me some good advice

#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
She said "Son you ought to quit this old ramblin' all around

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
And marry you a sweet loving wife"

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Honey look down that old lonesome road

Hang down your pretty head and cry

Cause I'm thinking all about them pretty little gals

And hoping that I'll never die

<br>

#### Chorus
