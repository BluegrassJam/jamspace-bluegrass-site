I've seen the lightning flashing I've heard the thunder roar

Somewhere on the dark side of town

My baby's with a new love the wind is howling on

I should be with her right now

<br>

**Cold sheets of rain pouring down is my love safe and warm**

**Where is she sleeping now**

**Cold sheets of rain pouring down**

<br>

Well I worry so about her she's afraid of storms

She needs someone to ease her mind

She needs someone with her to keep her safe and warm

Someone who's patient and kind

<br>
