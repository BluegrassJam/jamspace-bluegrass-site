I've seen the lightning flashin' I've heard the thunder roar
Somewhere on the dark side of town
My baby's with a new love the wind is howlin' on
I should be with her right now

Cold sheets of rain pouring down is my love safe and warm
Where is she sleeping now
Cold sheets of rain pouring down

Well I worry so about her she's afraid of storms
She needs someone to ease her mind
She needs someone with her to keep her safe and warm
Someone who's patient and kind

Cold sheets of rain pouring down is my love safe and warm
Where is she sleeping now
Cold sheets of rain pouring down
