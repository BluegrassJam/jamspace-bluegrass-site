**Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home.**

Oh bear my longing heart to him who bled and died for me.
Who's blood now cleanses from all sin and gives me victory.

#### CHORUS

I know I'm near the holy ranks of friends and kindred dear.
I brush the dew on Jordan's banks the crossing must be near.

#### CHORUS

I've almost gained my heavenly home. My spirit loudly sings.
The holy ones, behold they come. I hear the noise of wings.
