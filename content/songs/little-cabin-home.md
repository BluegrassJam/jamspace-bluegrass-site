#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
It seems there's a longing for you still
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
In our little cabin home on the hill

<br>

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Oh, someone has taken you from me**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**And left me here all alone**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**In our little cabin home on the hill**

<br>

I hope you are happy tonight as you are

But in my heart there's a longing for you still

I just keep it there so I won't be alone

In our little cabin home on the hill

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now when you have come to the end of the way

And find there's no more happiness for you

Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will

To our little cabin home on the hill

<br>

#### Chorus
