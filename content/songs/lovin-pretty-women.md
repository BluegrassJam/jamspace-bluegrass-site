#### G 
**If I could make a living loving pretty women**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**I could just what I please I could make a killing**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**I buy everybody all things that they be needing**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D                     
**If I could make a living loving pretty women**

<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
I aint no good at driving nails or traveling door to door
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
but I do what I got to do just like the day before
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
I can’t complain about scraping mud while others got it bad
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
I got pennies in my pocket and big dreams in my head.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

There's Cindy Ann and Lisa too

There's Jessica and Kate

I’ve been working seven days a week wish there were eight.

but I may not be a movie star but I take my time

I’ll always be a ramblin man with ramblin on my mind.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Well i need a brand new spirit I need a brand new song

I’ll know it when I hear it and I’ll sing it all day long

all day long and everywhere i just have one request

let me live to love and love to live and then lay me down to rest.

<br>

#### Chorus
