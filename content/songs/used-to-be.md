**Well you donâ€™t love me anymore my darlin** 

**I'm just a used to be to you**

**These cold kisses that you gave to me my darlin**

**Show me that you found somebody new**

<br>

Tomorrow's just another lonesome day

I know that you want me far away

You don't love me anymore my darling

Im just a used to be to you

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Gone are those good old days we spent together

I dont know if I can stand the pain

Knowing that you'll be gone forever

I'll never know your love again

<br>

#### Chorus
