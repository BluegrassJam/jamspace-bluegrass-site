Well you go round the bend and when you come back again there's a jug full o' good ole mountain dew

<br>

**Oh they call it that ole mountain dew and them that refuse it are few.**

**I'll shut up my mug if you fill up my jug with some good ole mountain dew.**

<br>

Now my uncle Nort, he's sawed off and short, he measures about four foot two,
 
but he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint of that good ole mountain dew.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Well my ole aunt Jill bought some brand new perfume. It had such a sweet smellin' pew,

but to her surprise, when she had it analyzed, it was nothing but good ole mountain dew.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Well the preacher rolled by with his head heisted high, said his wife had been down with the flu, 

and he thought that I ought just uh sell him a quart of that good ole mountain dew.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Well my brother Bill's got a still on the hill where he runs of a gallon or two.

Now the buzzards in the sky get so drunk they can't fly from smellin' the good ole mountain dew.

<br>

#### Chorus
