#### G
The days are long, and the nights are lonely.
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Since you left me all alone.
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
I worry so, my little darling.
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
I worry so, since you've been gone.

<br>

#### G
Sweetheart of mine, can't you hear me calling?
#### C
A million times I love you best.
#### G
I mistreated you, Lord and I'm sorry.
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Come back to me, is my request.

<br>

I remember dear, the night we parted.

A big mistake's caused it all.

If you'll return, sunshine will follow.

To stay away would be my fall.

<br>

#### Chorus
           
<br>           

The days are dark, my little darling.

Oh how I need your sweet embrace.

When I woke up, the sun was shining.

When I looked up I saw your face.

<br>

#### Chorus
