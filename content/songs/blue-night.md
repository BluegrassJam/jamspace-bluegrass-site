Blue night I got you on my mind. Blue night I can't keep from crying.

**G                                          C                                              G**

You met someone that was new. You quit someone that you knew was true.

                  **D**

Blue night I got you on my mind.

Blue night blue as I can be. I don't know what'll become of me.

Where we used to walk I walk alone with an aching heart because my love is gone.

Blue night blue as I can be.
<br>
Blue night 'cause I'm all alone. I used to call you on the telephone.

I used to call and it made you glad. Now I call and it makes you mad.

Blue night 'cause I'm all alone.
<br>
Blue night all by myself. Since you put me on that shelf.

There's just one thing that you must know. You're gonna reap just what you sow.

Blue night, all by myself.

Blue night, all by myself.
