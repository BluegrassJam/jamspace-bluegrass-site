#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Last night I dreamed you were back again
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em
Larger than life again, holdin' me tight again
#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Placein' those same kisses on my brow
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em
Sweeter than ever now Lord I remember how
#### D
Couldn't get enough of kissin'
#### Em
Do you know how much you're missin'
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
No you don't, but I do

<br>

Days like a slow train trickle by

Even the words that I write refuse to fly

All that I can hear is your song haunting me

Can't get the melody out of my head, you see

Distractions I've been using

Do you know how much you're losing

No you don't, but I do

<br>


#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
But I do and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Is no word from you at all
#### Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
The best that you can do
#### D                        
I never meant to push or shove you
#### Em
Do you know how much I love you
#### D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
No you don't, but I do

<br>

I swore I'd never fall like this again

Fools like me never win, came to my knees again

Can't close the door on the likelihood

Things might be just as good, always believed they would

Got to let your love invite me

Baby do you think it might be

No you don't, but I do

<br>
