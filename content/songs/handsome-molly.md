#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
Well I wish was in London or some other seaport town
#### G
Set my foot in a steamboat sail the ocean round

<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**Sailin’ round the ocean Sailin’ round the sea**
#### G
**I think of Handsome Molly Wherever she may be.**

<br>

Well I saw her at church last Sunday she passed me on by

I knew her mind was changin' by the rovin' of her eye

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now do you remember Molly when you give me your right hand

Said if you ever married that I would be the man

<br>

#### Chorus
