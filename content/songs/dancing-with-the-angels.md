#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
There's path with darkness there's a path with light 
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
And they meet at the old crossroads
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
The Angels are calling if your spirit will hearken 
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
All is forgiven; lay down your weary load

<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**You'll be dancing, dancing, dancing with the Angels**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**Just like old Daniel in the Lion's den**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C 
**The door will be open and the feast spread out before you** 
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**Dancing with the Angels while the Lion's roar.**

<br>

Old Satan's dark powers are hungry for confusion 

Unsatisfied ever greedy for more 

If you look to your heart at the spirit there a blooming

If it's bright and shining sin can harm you no more

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

King Angels of mercy are waiting there to greet you

Standing on the shores of ever lasting light 

They're saying come and join us acrossthe shining water 

Our lanterns of love will guide us though the night

<br>

#### Chorus
