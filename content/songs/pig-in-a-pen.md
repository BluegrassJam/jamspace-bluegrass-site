#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**I got a pig at home in a pen; Corn to feed 'im on**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**All I need's a pretty little girl to feed 'im when I'm gone.**

<br>

#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
Goin' on the mountain to sow a little cane
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Raise a barrel of Sorghum, To sweeten ol' Liza Jane.

<br>

Yonder comes that gal of mine, How do you think I know

I know by that gingham gown, Hanging down so low

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Dark cloud's a-risin' - surely a sign of rain

Get your gray bonnet on - Little Liza Jane.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Bake them biscuits, lady - bake 'em good n' brown

When you get them biscuits baked - we're Alabam-y bound

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

When she sees me comin' - she wrings her hands and cries

Yonder comes the sweetest boy - that ever lived or died.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now, when she sees me leavin' - she wrings her hands and cries

Yonder goes the meanest boy - that ever lived or died.

<br>

#### Chorus
