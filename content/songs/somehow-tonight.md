#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Somehow tonight I feel lonely my darling**
#### D7
**Somehow tonight I feel blue**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Somehow tonight these tears of mine keep falling**
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
**Come back sweetheart and be true**

<br>

#### C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
I thought you're love was something I could treasure
#### D7
To brighten my pathway through the years
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Now all I can see is darkness in the future
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
That's why I long to have you near

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I never knew what loneliness meant darling

Until I watched you walk away

I long to hear you whisper that you love me

I can't forget our happy days

<br>

####  Chorus
