<pre class="nobackground">G             C                    G</pre>
I'm breaking in a brand new pair of shoes
<pre class="nobackground">	          C                             G</pre>
Don't look at me like you think I've got the blues
<pre class="nobackground">C                              G		      Em</pre>	
'Cause I'm walking 'round and around and I'm seeing most of the town
<pre class="nobackground">G          D               G</pre>     
I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes

<br>

I'm doggone if I'm gonna cry the blues

My feet are sore but I've got no time to lose

'Cause I'm wanting her here with me and I'm needing her company

I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes

<pre class="nobackground">C                     G</pre>
**Ah ha so I'm talking to myself**
<pre class="nobackground">C                     D</pre>
**Oh no she's not putting me on the shelf**
<pre class="nobackground">G              D            G</pre>     
**I'm just breaking in a brand new pair of shoes**
