**We're going to lay darling Corey down**

<br>

Well, now the first time I seen darling Corey ,she was a standing on the banks of the sea.

A 45 Pistol on her forearm and a banjo on her knee.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Wake up, wake up, darling Corey what makes you sleep so sound?

Them darn highway robbers a coming their going to tear your playhouse down.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Wake up, wake up Darlin Corey and go get me my gun

I ain't no man for fightin' But I'll die before I run.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Can't you hear those bluebirds a singing? Don't you hear that mournful sound?

They're preaching darling Corey's funeral in some lonesome graveyard ground.
