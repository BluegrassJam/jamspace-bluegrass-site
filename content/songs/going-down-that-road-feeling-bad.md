### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D

**Goin' down the road feelin' bad.**

**Goin' down the road feelin' bad.**

**Goin' down the road feelin' bad.**

**I don't want to be treated this away.**

<br>

Goin' where the climate suits my clothes.

Goin' where the climate suits my clothes.

Goin' where the climate suits my clothes.

I don't want to be treated this away.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Goin' down the road feelin' bad.

Goin' down the road feelin' bad.

Goin' down the road feelin' bad.

I don't want to be treated this away.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Goin' where the water tastes like wine.

Goin' where the water tastes like wine.

Potomac water tastes like turpentine.

I don't want to be treated this away.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Goin' down the road feelin' bad.

Goin' down the road feelin' bad.

Goin' down the road feelin' bad.

I don't want to be treated this away.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Goin' where the chilly winds don't blow.

Goin' where the chilly winds don't blow.

Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow.

I don't want to be treated this away
