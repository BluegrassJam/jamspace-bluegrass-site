Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk
      D    A    G
On a day-I-ay-I-ay
D
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
      D          G    D
on a grand soft day-I-ay
      G          D               G        D
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
            Bm        A            G         D
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
        G         D           G         D
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl
            Bm        A           G      D
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

G  D  G  D     A     D


D
We were halfway there when the rain came down
                G
On a day-I-ay-I-ay
        D
And she took me up to her flat downtown
       D         G          D
Of a grand soft day-I-ay-I-ay
      G          D               G       D
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do
            Bm        A             G         D
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue
      G        D          G          D
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
       Bm       A          G      D
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl


D     D     D     G
G  D  G  D  A     D
G                 A
G  D  G  Bm A     D


D                                          G
When I woke up I was all alone
         D                              G  D
With a broken heart and a ticket home
      G        D            G             D
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do
       Bm         A            G          D
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
       G        D                  G          D
I've traveled around I've been all over this world
        Bm               A              G      D
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl

G  D  G  Bm A     D
