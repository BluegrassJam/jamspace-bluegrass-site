Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk Of a day -I-ay-I-ay

I met a little girl and we stopped to talk Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay

<br>

**And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do**

**Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue**

**And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl**

**'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl**

<br>
We were halfway there when the rain came down Of a day -I-ay-I-ay

And she asked me up to her flat downtown Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

When I woke up I was all alone with a broken heart and a ticket home

<br>

#### Chorus
