#### C
My window faces the South,
#### C7 
and I'm almost halfway to heaven
#### F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f#aug &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A7
The snow is fallin' but all I can see
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Are those fields of cotton smilin' back at me

<br>
   
My Window faces the South
   
and though I am far from that Swanee

I'm never frownin' or down in the mouth

My Window faces the South
