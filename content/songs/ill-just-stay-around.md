Now you just told me that you're leaving

on the next train coming down

I love you dear but I won't follow

I just think I'll stay around

<br>

**for someday I know you'll want me**

**when your true love can't be found**

**but if you go dear I won't follow**

**I just think I'll stay around**

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Now you'll admit I've always loved you

and I've never let you down

So if you go dear I won't follow

I just think I'll stay around

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Someday I'll hear the whistle blowin

on the special coming down

and you'll be looking for me baby

but I may not be around
