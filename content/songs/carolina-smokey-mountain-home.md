#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**Carolina Smokey Mountain home**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**Closest thing to Heaven that I’ve ever known**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C
**That’s where my thoughts return, when I’m feeling all alone**
#### G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D
**My Carolina Smokey Mountain home**

<br>
			
Often times I miss my Smokey Mountain childhood

And the cabin where I used to play

It’s the only place on Earth a little boy could

Never find an unhappy day

<br>

#### Chorus

I grew up and took a job in downtown Knoxville

Not too far from my home in Caroline

Though, my life’s too hard to bear, I can return there

To that sweet, sweet Smoky Mountain home of mine

#### Chorus
