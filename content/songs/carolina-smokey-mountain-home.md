Chorus
G                                C
Carolina Smokey Mountain home
G			D
Closest thing to Heaven that I’ve ever known
G			C
That’s where my thoughts return, when I’m feeling all alone
G			D
My Carolina Smokey Mountain home
Verse 1
G			
Often times I miss my Smokey Mountain childhood
And the cabin where I used to play
It’s the only place on Earth a little boy could
Never find an unhappy day
Verse 2
I grew up and took a job in downtown Knoxville
Not too far from my home in Caroline
Though, my life’s too hard to bear, I can return there
To that sweet, sweet Smoky Mountain home of mine
Ending
That’s where my thoughts return, when I’m feeling all alone
To my Carolina Smoky Mountain home
