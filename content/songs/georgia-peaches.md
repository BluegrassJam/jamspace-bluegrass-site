#### Dm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A

Way down south round Macon Georgia, where the sweetest peaches grow.

I wondered there to take my chances, Twenty some odd years ago.

I'll not forget first time I saw her, A vivid picture in my dreams.

A southern bell in soft white cotton, clinging to her like a breeze.

<br>

**Nothings sweet as Georgia peaches, when you pick them for yourself.**

**Wait too long therere out of season, Theyll be gone to someone else.**

<br>

She ask me Boy where do you come from? Are you only passing through?

Id like to know what brings you down here, I made her smile when I said YOU.

A stolen moment too quickly faded, as she pulled away her hand.

She said Im sorry its been taken, promised to another man.

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Sometimes in dreams that Macon highway, winding through the lonesome pines.

Takes me back to my favorite memory, Of the Georgia girl I left behind.

<br>
