Honey you don't know my mind I'm lonesome all the time
#### D7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G
Now you’re born to lose a drifter that's me

You can travel for so long till a rambler's heart goes wrong

Baby you don't know my mind today

<br>

I've been a hobo and a tramp my soul has done been stamped
     
Thank God though I’ve learned the hard hard way

When I find I can't win I'll be checking out again

Baby you don't know my mind today

<br>

Heard the music of the rail slept in every old dirty jail

And life's too short for you to worry me

You say I'm sweet and kind I can love a thousand times

Baby you don't know my mind today

<br>
                                                    
Honey you don't know my mind I was born the restless kind

You made it rough let’s keep it that way

You’re gonna find you were wrong when your loving daddy’s gone

Baby you don't know my mind today


<br>

You’re gonna find you were wrong when your loving daddy’s gone

Baby you don't know my mind today
