Have you ever been to Richmond in November

When the cold Virginia rain is coming down

Friends I'm here to tell you it's no pleasure

When you're all alone and a stranger to this town.

<br>

Don't take me wrong I do like East Virginia

And Richmond's full of hospitality

Except for one Virginia girl I know of

Who made a perfect love wreck out of me.

<br>

**Blue blue Virginia blue**

**There's no blue like blue Virginia blue**

**No other girls in the whole wide world**

**Will break your heart like Virginia girls**

**There's no blue like blue Virginia blue**

<br>

She called me up in St Paul Minnisota

Said I need you here in Richmond right away

Take the bus I'll meet you at the station

Bring your clothes 'cause I want you to stay.

<br>

My bus pulled in the station late this evening

And there's no one around this place but me

She must have changed her mind or she's forgotten

And her name's not in the phone directory.

<br>

#### Chorus

I wish I had the money for a taxi

And a warm and cozy place to go lie down

Instead of standin' all alone in Richmond

While the cold Virginia rain is comin' down.

#### Chorus
