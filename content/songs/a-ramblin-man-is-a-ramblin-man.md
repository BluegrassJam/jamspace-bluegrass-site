#### Chords: G, C


A steel wheel rides a steel rail and a rubber wheel rides the road.

The ground underneath my boot heels burns right through my soul, right through my weary soul.

<br>

Wild fire travels on a wayward wind through a field of broken dreams.

Your memory flies through my restless heart on fallen angel’s wings.

<br>

#### CHORUS

<br>

**I wish I could have stayed. I wish I could have changed.** 

**But a ramblin’ man is a ramblin’ man by any other name, by any other name**

<br>

Some men are made to plant their feet and stay right where the are.

Some build their homes on the shifting sands beneath the shooting stars, the bright shining stars.

<br>

A women like you was born to love with a kind and gentle hand.

But I was born a rolling stone and I’ll die a ramblin’ man.

<br>

#### CHORUS

<br>

Someday you may forgive me for leaving you all alone.

But I can’t deny the wanderlust and the call of the open road, the call of the open road.

<br>
