Standin' on the corner with the lowdown blues a great big hole in the bottom of my shoes

Honey let me be your salty dog

<br>

**Let me be your salty dog but I won't be your man at all**

**Honey let me be your salty dog**

<br>

Looky here Sal well I know you rundown stocking and a worn out shoe

Honey let me be your Salty Dog

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Down in the wildwood sittin' on a log finger on the trigger and eye on the hog

Honey let me be your Salty Dog

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

Pulled the trigger and they said go shot fell over in Mexico

Honey let me be you Salty Dog

<br>

#### Chorus

<br>

I like corn and I like grits and I like girls with great big smiles.

Honey let me be you Salty Dog
