Sing a song on friday night, drink a little beer, wishing that suzanne were here.

a face like a summers sky, an angel would have choose Suzanne like nobody knows

<br>

**Suzanne, going down the road, carrying everybody's load**

**Suzanne, i can see your smile, won't you stop and talk to me a while**

<br>

every day when the morning sun comes up to shine I remember Suzanne once was mine

she used to say to me better walk the line sad songs will get you every time

<br>

#### Chorus
