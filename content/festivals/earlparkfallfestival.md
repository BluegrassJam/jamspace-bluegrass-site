Widely known for its free family entertainment the Earl Park Fall Festival was founded in 1972 to gather the community in celebration over Labor Day weekend every year. Over the years, it has vastly grown to include events such as a Truck & Tractor Pull, Demolition Derby, Auto Show, Mud Volleyball, Softball, and bluegrass music.

Anyone attending the festival can enjoy a craft and flea market, bluegrass music, and concession food stands each day of the festival. There is a different dinner specialty everyday, including a fish fry, spaghetti dinner, chicken noodle dinner, and chicken dinner. 
 
There is no admission fee and parking is also free.
